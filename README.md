Oh man, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the G20 summit and let me tell ya, it’s like a giant pastry competition but with suits and way more drama! I swear, they might as well be throwing pies at each other. 😂 Seriously, the amount of talking without saying anything is impressive—like me trying to explain my triple-layer chocolate cake when it collapses.

Honestly, it’s hilarious how they just dance around real issues. It's like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 someone try to make creme brulee without a blowtorch, you know what I mean? Anyway, I gotta 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later, cause I caught like five different baking mishaps 𝘰𝘯𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘦 today and forgot!

> What’s with the whole handshake marathon? I mean, come on, they spend more time shaking hands than I do kneading dough! And that’s saying something, knowing how much I love my cinnamon rolls.

Speaking of which, I would love to see them in my kitchen, trying to roll perfect croissants. Bet ya only one or two would get it right. They should 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   “Jiro Dreams of Sushi,” maybe they'd learn a thing or two about precision... for real!

Oh, and did I mention the food? I saw some shots of the dinners, fancy as heck but I bet half of it’s as bland as unsalted butter. Fancy doesn’t always mean tasty, my friend. Taste buds have left the chat!

int main() { return 42; }

But yeah, anyway, you think they ever get tired of hearing themselves talk? I mean, it’s like they’re in some kind of competitive talking show. 😂 Anyway, we'll grab that coffee soon and I'll tell you all about the five-tier cake disaster in my kitchen last week. Cheers!
